# Privacy Policy for v0 Dark Mode Chrome Extension

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the v0 Dark Mode Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and discloses information from users. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience using our extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The v0 Dark Mode Chrome Extension is designed to enhance your experience on v0.dev/chat by providing a customizable dark mode interface. In order to provide this functionality, our extension:

1. Does not collect any personal information
2. Does not track your browsing history
3. Does not store any user data on our servers

The only information stored is your color mode preference (light, dark, or system), which is saved locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This information never leaves your device and is used solely to remember your preferred setting between sessions.

## Data Storage

Your color mode preference is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data is not transmitted to any external servers and is only accessible by the v0 Dark Mode extension.

## Permissions

Our extension requires the following permissions:

1. `storage`: To save your color mode preference locally.
2. `activeTab`: To apply the dark mode styles to the active v0.dev/chat tab.
3. `https://v0.dev/*`: To ensure the extension only runs on v0.dev domains.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the extension and do not allow access to any personal information or browsing data.

## Third-Party Services

The v0 Dark Mode extension does not use any third-party services or analytics tools. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the version number of the extension.
